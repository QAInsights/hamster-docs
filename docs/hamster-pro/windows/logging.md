# Logging Info

All important transactions are logged locally for debugging purposes, including features, JMeter commands, and more.

To access the log file in Windows, open the `C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\Local\hamster.log` file in your preferred text editor.

This will very helpful in case if JMeter is not launching or JMeter not lauched with the pro features enabled and more.
