# Logging Info

All important transactions are logged locally for debugging purposes, including features, JMeter commands, and more.

To access the log file in Mac, open the `/Users/<user_name>/hamster_logs/hamster.log` file in your preferred text editor.

This will very helpful in case if JMeter is not launching or JMeter not lauched with the pro features enabled and more.
