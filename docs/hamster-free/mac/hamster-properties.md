## Hamster Properties Configuration

After a successful installation, the Hamster properties file will be located at `/Users/<user_name>/.hamster_app.properties`.

By default, the `.hamster_app.properties` file contains the following configuration for JMeter:

```toml
[JMETER]
home = /Users/<user_name>/Tools/apache-jmeter-5.6.2

[TELEMETRY]
enabled = true
```

If you want to change the JMeter version, you can make the changes in here and restart the Hamster to reflect the changes.
