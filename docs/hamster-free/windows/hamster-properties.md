## Hamster Properties Configuration

After a successful installation, the Hamster properties file will be located at `C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\Local\Programs\QAInsights\Hamster\hamster_app.properties`.

By default, the `hamster_app.properties` file contains the following configuration for JMeter:

```toml
[JMETER]
home = C:\Tools\apache-jmeter-5.6.2
```

If you want to change the JMeter version, you can make the changes in here and restart the Hamster to reflect the changes.
